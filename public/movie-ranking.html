<h4>The Best Movies According to Dorothe</h4>
<h5>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h5>
<h6>The Convert</h6>
<P>This is not an uncommon chapter in history, but the way Tamahori
   and his cast and crew approach the topic is fascinating, 
   even if sometimes a little conflicted. 
</P>
<h6>My Spy The Eternal City </h6>
<P>Four years later, “My Spy The Eternal City” arrives, and it takes this
   playful story in a strangely darker direction. It is hard to tell who this movie is for:
   It is too silly for adults, yet way too grown up for kids.
</P>
<h6>Goldilocks and the Two Bears</h6>
<P>In Jeff Lipsky's films, it's normal for characters to talk for ten minutes straight,
    and it's normal for other characters to listen without interrupting. 
   You have to just go with the convention. Or, not. You don't "have" to do anything.
